# Unit Testing with Angular 14 (Jasmine and Karma)

### Main Topics

### Concept of a test suite in Angular
- Test suite - describe;
  The describe function in Angular tests is used to group related test cases into a suite for better organization and readability.
- Specifications of these - it;
  The it function in Angular tests is used to define an individual test case with a specific expectation.
- Before each test - beforeEach;
  The beforeEach function in Angular tests is used to set up a common state or configuration that should be applied to each individual test case in a describe block.
- After each test - afterEach;
  The afterEach function in Angular tests is used to perform cleanup or reset tasks after each individual test case in a describe block.
- Before all - beforeAll;
  The beforeAll function in Angular tests is used to set up a common state or configuration that should be applied once before all the test cases in a describe block are run.
- Configuring the test modules - TestBeb.
  The TestBed in Angular tests is a utility that provides a test environment to configure and create instances of components and services to be tested.
